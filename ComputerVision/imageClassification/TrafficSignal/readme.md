Trained two different models for classifying traffic signs from raw pixels. With a dataset that is compatible with Torchvision.

<!-- [Read the tutorial](https://www.curiousily.com/posts/transfer-learning-for-image-classification-using-torchvision-pytorch-and-python/) -->

Implimented:

- Overview of the traffic sign image dataset
- Build a dataset
- Use a pre-trained model from Torchvision
- Add a new *unknown* class and re-train the model
