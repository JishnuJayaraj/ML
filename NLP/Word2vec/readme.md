## Create a word 2 vec model from scratch using gensim library.
- uses batch processing for loading extremly large data
- save the model for future use

## Extracting the keywords
- also filter the keywords on custom list


## Clustering the vectors


## Visualization in tensorboard (with cluster value)



## Improving the model 
- using a pretrained model and training on domain data
